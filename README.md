# Linear Regression: My First Project

Welcome to my first project on Linear Regression! This project marks my journey into the exciting world of Machine Learning (ML). It is an introductory implementation of linear regression to predict numerical values based on given data. The goal is to explore the basics of machine learning and understand how linear regression works.

## Project Overview

Linear regression is a simple and powerful machine learning algorithm used for predictive modeling. As my first ML project, I implemented linear regression to:

- Analyze the relationship between features and the target variable.
- Build a predictive model using Python libraries.
- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

```

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. Install the required libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install them using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### Dataset

The dataset used for this project is located in the `data/` directory. If you want to use your own dataset, replace the existing file with your dataset and update the file path in the notebook.

### Running the Notebook

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Linear-Regression-(my-first-project).ipynb
   ```

2. Execute the cells to see the implementation and results.

## Key Features

- Data preprocessing: Handling missing values and feature scaling.
- Data visualization: Exploring relationships between features and target variable using visualizations.
- Model training: Implementing linear regression using `scikit-learn`.
- Model evaluation: Calculating performance metrics.

## Results

The notebook provides detailed steps for:

- Visualizing data distributions and correlations.
- Training and testing the linear regression model.
- Evaluating the model’s performance metrics.
